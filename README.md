This repo releases the data and code for the paper:

- MCAD-MM: A Benchmark Dataset and Method for Multi-Channel Acoustic Detection of Marine Mammals

## Overview

The MCAD-MM introduces a novel approach for the acoustic detection of marine mammals using deep learning. It establishes a comprehensive benchmark dataset and methodology that encompasses a wide range of marine mammal acoustic signals and ambient seawater noises. This provides essential data support and methodological guidance for advancing research in related fields.
